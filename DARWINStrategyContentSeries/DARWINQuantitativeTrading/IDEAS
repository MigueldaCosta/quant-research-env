# Test if monthly rebalance of DARWINs with certain investment att threshold yields returns.

# Test if any attribute is predictable of future inmediate or short term returns.

# Test if a combination of changes (daily, weekly, monthly) of investment attributes (returns, second derivative) are predictable of future returns.

# Test for feature importance of attributes in future returns.

# Test for risk neutral portfolio in Darwins (if you cannot predict, try to have the least risk possible > HERC, test correlations...).

# Test for mean reverting or momemtum patterns.

# Test for cointegration between DARWINs > We cannot sell them yet.
